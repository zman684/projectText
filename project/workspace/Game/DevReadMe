Hello everybody!

if(you != "new"){
	read("Please edit this with info that you think would
	be useful for the new developers that might join.");
}else{
	read("This game is a bit-by-bit game meaning that we
	work not daily on it. So if you have ideas or want to
	know what you should work on email 'toorealc@yahoo.com'
	or post and issue on github!")
}
(I thought this was a funny idea :P)
