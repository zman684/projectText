Text Adventure Game
-------------------

This game aims to bring back the nostalgia of playing the old style of games. Where the focus was the plot and development of the characters and not about how many polygons are in a tree on the corner of a map. What matters here is not the processing power of your computer but instead the processing power of your mind.
